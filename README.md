# Introduction-to-Pandas-Numpy-For-Beginners
This is a tutorial about NumPy and Pandas Libraries for Beginners. 

When I was a beginner at Python Language, I had finished Engin Demirog's Course in Udemy Platform.  I repeated the examples after the lesson. I highly recommend this course can help you. If you want to learn Python. Making these examples will bring you to a basic level.

As you can see , I used to work on these datasets. You can work on different datasets as well. As you will see over time, I used functions and exercises pretty basic. But it is important to keep the foundation intact.

With my best regards.
